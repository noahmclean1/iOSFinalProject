BudgetBuddy (v1.1)

App Designed by Noah McLean
------------------------------------
Instructions:

No user logins are required. Although
the app functions just fine with a few
categories and transactions, it is far better
to use with many transactions and categories.
This allows you to see the full scale of
the visualization tools!
